Omnostock: The AI-Powered Inventory System That You’ve Always Needed
At Blackroot Labs, we don’t just build products — we engineer intelligent systems that shift the ground beneath industries. After 7 relentless weeks of iteration, edge-case debugging, and deep customer research, we’re proud to unveil Omnostock: an AI-powered inventory management platform built to solve the real, brutal problems faced by modern e-commerce operations — online and offline.
This isn’t just software. This is a control tower for your inventory, built to scale your ops, cut your waste, and predict your next move — intelligently.
Why We Built Omnostock
Most inventory systems treat your business like a spreadsheet with buttons. They lack intelligence, adaptability, and worst of all — they assume your entire operations happen online.
But Omnostock is different.
It was built from scratch to serve the hybrid realities of commerce today — where warehouses, storefronts, and social shops all converge, and inventory mistakes are expensive.
Core Features That Matter
We didn’t build buzzwords. We built for what real businesses actually struggle with.
Real-Time Inventory Sync: Live syncing with your online store — Shopify, WooCommerce, or custom builds — means inventory stays accurate and up to date, always.
Offline Inventory Management: Omnostock isn't just for e-commerce. It supports offline product catalogs, allowing teams to manage physical stock in pop-ups, warehouses, or retail outlets with the same accuracy and intelligence.
Stock Transfer Between Locations: Easily move inventory across different warehouses or retail locations. Every transfer is logged, auditable, and reflected in your reporting engine.
Record Sales for Offline Inventory: Manually or automatically log sales from in-person events, WhatsApp, or walk-ins. This ensures your data remains complete across all touchpoints.
Sales History & Logs: Drill into every sale made — whether online or offline. Perfect for reconciling returns, identifying fraud, or doing performance reviews.
Advanced Location-Based Reports: Get granular insights per outlet or warehouse. See what’s selling in Lagos vs. London, or which location is underperforming — all at a glance.
Smart Reorder Recommendations (AI-Powered): AI analyzes your historical sales, seasonality, and supply timelines to recommend restocks — before you even know you need them.
Auto-Purchase Order Generator: Omnostock converts low-stock alerts into full supplier-ready purchase orders. Send them via WhatsApp, Email, or export them — instantly.
Sell-Through & Product Velocity Analytics: Discover your fastest-moving SKUs, deadstock items, and hidden top performers. Perfect for refining marketing spend and product strategy.
Multi-User Access & Role Permissions: From inventory managers to sales assistants, define exactly who can do what — and prevent costly errors or unauthorized actions.
Built-in Forecast Engine: No more stock panic. Omnostock uses AI to forecast demand, suggest reorder windows, and help you prep for spikes and slumps.
We even ran it in live retail environments to break it intentionally — and rebuild it smarter.
Why It’s a Game-Changer
Omnostock gives growing commerce brands the kind of operational infrastructure only enterprise companies used to afford — but with the flexibility, intelligence, and affordability tailored for the modern market.
Whether you sell on your own website, through DMs, in a physical store, or across several warehouses — this is the one system that keeps your stock, team, and growth aligned.
Available Now — But Not As SaaS
Omnostock isn’t available as a public SaaS — yet. We’re deploying it as a customized implementation through Blackroot Labs. We adapt it to your stack, workflows, team, and market realities.
